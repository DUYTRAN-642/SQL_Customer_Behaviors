‚öíÔ∏è Main Process

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

The purpose of this query is to extract valuable financial data related to customer purchases and product prices, which can be leveraged for various business and marketing decisions

```sql
SELECT
  	t1.customer_id
    ,sum(t2.price) as total_amount
FROM dannys_diner.sales as t1
left join dannys_diner.menu as t2
on t1.product_id = t2.product_id
group by 1
order by 1;
```
**Schema (PostgreSQL v13)**

    CREATE SCHEMA dannys_diner;
    SET search_path = dannys_diner;
    
    CREATE TABLE sales (
      "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
      "order_date" DATE,
      "product_id" INTEGER
    );
    
    INSERT INTO sales
      ("customer_id", "order_date", "product_id")
    VALUES
      ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
      ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
      ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
      ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
      ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
      ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
      ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),
      ('B', '2021-01-02', '2'),
      ('B', '2021-01-04', '1'),
      ('B', '2021-01-11', '1'),
      ('B', '2021-01-16', '3'),
      ('B', '2021-02-01', '3'),
      ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
      ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
      ('C', '2021-01-07', '3');
     
    
    CREATE TABLE menu (
      "product_id" INTEGER,
      "product_name" VARCHAR(5),
      "price" INTEGER
    );
    
    INSERT INTO menu
      ("product_id", "product_name", "price")
    VALUES
      ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
      ('2', 'curry', '15'),
      ('3', 'ramen', '12');
      
    
    CREATE TABLE members (
      "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
      "join_date" DATE
    );
    
    INSERT INTO members
      ("customer_id", "join_date")
    VALUES
      ('A', '2021-01-07'),
      ('B', '2021-01-09');
